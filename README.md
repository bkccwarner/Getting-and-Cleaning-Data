#Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

##Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project 

The purpose of this project is to collect, work 
with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare 
tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The
following is submitted: 

1.  A R script named **run_Analysis.r** that: 
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create 
     one data set;
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and 
     standard deviation for each measurement; 
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the 
     activities in the data set;
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive 
     variable names; *and* 
    * Create a second, independent tidy data set names **tidydata1.txt** with the 
     average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2.  A link to a Github repository with a script 
    for performing the analysis.
3.  A code book named **CodeBook** that describes the variables, the data, 
    and any transformations or work that you performed 
    to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
