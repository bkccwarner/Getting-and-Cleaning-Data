Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project Repo

The purpose of this project is to collect, work 
with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare 
tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The
following is submitted: 

*1) a tidy data set that: 
    *Merges the training and the test sets to create 
     one data set.
    *Extracts only the measurements on the mean and 
     standard deviation for each measurement. 
    *Uses descriptive activity names to name the 
     activities in the data set
    *Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive 
     variable names. 
    *Create a second, independent tidy data set with the 
     average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

*2) a link to a Github repository with a script 
    for performing the analysis, and 
*3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, 
    and any transformations or work that you performed 
    to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
